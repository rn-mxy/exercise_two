For the second task we could choose between two proposed topics: Generative Logo Design and Beauty of Math. 
First, we recorded our ideas as a sketch or wrote them down as simple notes so that they could form our basis. Then we were free to choose how to handle the task, but it should be programmed object-oriented and include some form of interaction.

I chose a mixture of a logo and the beauty of mathematics for the topic. It is based to a very large extent on the noise effect and thus creates a logo, but it also shows how natural this effect can look, even though it is completely calculated. I intentionally kept the sketch in black and white, because this way the very fine lines or "threads" are shown to their full advantage.
